# AthletiQ – Football Player Management System

**AthletiQ** is a Windows Forms-based application developed in **C#** with **MySQL** integration, designed to streamline football player management for team managers. This system allows for adding, updating, removing, and tracking players efficiently — including their injury status — through a clean, event-driven user interface.

This project was created as part of the **Fundamentals of Software Engineering** course using **Agile development methodology** across multiple sprints.
